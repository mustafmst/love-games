### **Challenge: "Dodge the Falling Objects"**

Create a game where the player controls a character that must dodge falling objects for as long as possible. The longer the player survives, the higher their score.

---

### **Requirements:**

1. **Player Movement:**
   - Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to move the player left and right.
   - The player should stay within the screen boundaries.

2. **Falling Objects:**
   - Randomly spawn objects at the top of the screen.
   - Objects should fall at increasing speeds as time progresses.

3. **Collision Detection:**
   - If the player collides with a falling object, the game ends.

4. **Score System:**
   - Display the player's score based on how long they survive.

5. **Restart Mechanic:**
   - Allow the player to restart the game by pressing a key (e.g., `R`).

### **Stretch Goals (Optional):**

- Add different types of falling objects with varying speeds and sizes.
- Include power-ups (e.g., temporary invincibility or slowing down objects).
- Add background music and sound effects for collisions and scoring.
- Create a main menu and a "Game Over" screen.
